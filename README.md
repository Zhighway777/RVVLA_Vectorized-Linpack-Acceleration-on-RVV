# Vectorized-Linpack-Acceleration-on-RISC-V-RVVLA-
ur aim is to leverage RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) to vectorize the Linpack Benchmark, achieving optimal performance on RISC-V SIMD architecture. By exploiting the vector processing capabilities of RVV, we aim to enhance computational efficiency and accelerate floating-point operations within high-performance computing environments.
